Logbook about `cardano-blueprint` that contains thinking, discussions, pains, joys, events, and experiences that happen on a daily basis. It is supposed to be a kind of [Stream of consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_of_consciousness) that can later be searched, linked to or reviewed. It may also be used as a very informal decision log.
